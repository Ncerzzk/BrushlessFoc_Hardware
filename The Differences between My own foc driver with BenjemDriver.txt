PB1(Current A)      PC2

Voltage Measure
PC2                 PC0

The Res of Voltage Measuring
39K                 100K
2k2                 10K

The Gain of The OP of Current Measuring
40(edited by myself)      50

The Res of Current Measuring
3mR       3mR

The equation of Current Measuring
Vo = Vref - G*V_shunt
so,
V_shunt = (Vref-Vo)/G         V_shunt = (Vo-Vref)/G (ina181)
